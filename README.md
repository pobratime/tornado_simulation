# How to set up and run
If you are using PyCharm the dependencies should set up by themselves, and you should be able to run the code out of the box

## Linux and Macos
1. Adding permission to .sh file to create venv
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ```
2. Running .sh file to set up venv
    ```bash
    source setup.sh
    ```
3. Running file inside venv
    ```bash
    python3 tornado.py
    ```
4. Deactivating venv
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

## Windows
1. Create venv
   ```bat
   call setup.bat
   ```
2. Execute inside of venv
   ```bat
   python3 tornado.py
   ```
3. Deactivating venv
